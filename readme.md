üö¶ Project Overview

TrafficTelligence aims to predict traffic volume using historical data and machine learning techniques. It leverages weather, temporal, and holiday data to estimate vehicle counts, helping optimize traffic flow and urban planning.

üß† Machine Learning Pipeline

1. Data Preprocessing

Dataset: Includes features like date/time, weather conditions, holidays, and traffic volume.

Steps:

Missing values handled using mean/mode imputation.

Date and time split into granular components (day, month, hour, etc.).

Categorical encoding using LabelEncoder.

Feature scaling for numerical columns.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis

Visualizations:

Heatmap: Shows correlation between features.

PairPlot: Highlights relationships and clustering potential.

BoxPlot: Identifies outliers and distribution spread.

3. Model Training

Models used:

Linear Regression

Decision Tree Regressor

Random Forest Regressor

Support Vector Regressor (SVR)

XGBoost Regressor

4. Model Evaluation

Metrics:

R¬≤ Score: Measures prediction accuracy.

RMSE: Root Mean Squared Error for average prediction error.

Best Model: Random Forest Regressor (lowest RMSE).

5. Deployment

Model serialized using pickle:

model.pkl: Trained Random Forest model.

encoder.pkl: Encoded categorical features for future predictions.

üåç Real-World Applications

Dynamic Traffic Management: Adjust signal timings and lane configurations.

Urban Planning: Design infrastructure based on predicted traffic loads.

Navigation Systems: Guide commuters with real-time traffic forecasts.
